# Security Policy

This policy covers the **Too Many Cooks** MCP server, the VS Code extension, and the
published npm packages (`too-many-cooks`, `too-many-cooks-core`). See GitHub's docs:

- [Add a security policy](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/configure-vulnerability-reporting/add-security-policy)
- [Configure private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/report-and-fix-vulnerabilities/configure-vulnerability-reporting/configure-for-a-repository)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Report privately through GitHub's **private vulnerability reporting**: go to the
repository's **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability** (or
<https://github.com/Nimblesite/too-many-cooks/security/advisories/new>). This opens a
private, structured advisory only the maintainers can see.

If you cannot use that channel, email **cftools@nimblesite.co**.

When reporting, please include:

- The type of issue (e.g. injection, path traversal, auth bypass, secret exposure,
  message-privacy leak between agents).
- The affected version(s), file(s), and any relevant configuration.
- Steps to reproduce, ideally a minimal proof of concept.
- The impact: what an attacker can achieve.

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** within **3 business days**.
- An assessment and a remediation plan (or a reasoned decline) within **10 business days**.
- Coordinated disclosure: we will agree a disclosure timeline with you and credit
  you in the advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
