# Too Many Cooks - Multi-Agent Coordination MCP Server

CRITICAL: THERE IS ONLY ONE SERVER. IT SERVES BOTH MCP and ADMIN ROUTES.

## Overview

MCP server enabling multiple AI agents to safely edit a git repository simultaneously. Provides advisory file locking, agent identity, inter-agent messaging, plan visibility, and real-time event notifications.

**Location**: `examples/too_many_cooks/`

**Tech Stack**: Dart on Node.js, better-sqlite3 via JS interop, dart_node_mcp, dart_node_express, FP (typedef records, Result<T,E>)

## Architecture

Single HTTP server per workspace. **Everything** talks to the server — agents via MCP Streamable HTTP, VSCode extension via admin REST + [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http). Nothing touches the DB directly except the server.

```

ONE HTTP server:
- **`/mcp`** — MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint for agents. Tool calls via POST, event stream via GET [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http).
- **`/admin/*`** — REST endpoints + [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) event stream for the VSCode extension. Not exposed to MCP clients. VSIX receives all state changes via [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) push — no polling.

**Database path**: `${workspaceFolder}/.too_many_cooks/data.db` (single source of truth in `too_many_cooks_data` package).

**Transport**: Streamable HTTP with [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http). Server pushes events (new messages, lock changes, etc.) to all connected clients (agents + VSIX) in real-time. No polling anywhere.

**Why HTTP, not stdio**: Stdio spawns an isolated process per agent — agents can't see each other's events. HTTP gives one shared process where the notification emitter actually works across all connected agents.

## Database Schema

```mermaid
erDiagram
    identity ||--o{ locks : holds
    identity ||--o{ messages : sends
    identity ||--o| plans : has
```

| Table | Columns |
|-------|---------|
| identity | agent_name (PK), agent_key, active (boolean), registered_at, last_active |
| locks | file_path (PK), agent_name (FK), acquired_at, expires_at, reason, version |
| messages | id (PK), from_agent (FK), to_agent, content, created_at, read_at |
| plans | agent_name (PK/FK), goal, current_task, updated_at |

---

## MCP Tools

### `register`
Register or reconnect an agent. Sets session identity for the connection.
- **First call**: `{ name }` only (1-50 chars) — creates agent, returns key ONLY once — store it!
- **Reconnect**: `{ key }` only — server looks up the agent name from the key. Specifying both `name` and `key` is an error.
- Output: `{ agent_name, agent_key }`

### `lock`
Advisory file locks.
- Actions: `acquire`, `release`, `force_release`, `renew`, `query`, `list`
- `acquire/release/renew`: uses session identity + file_path
- `force_release`: only works on expired locks
- `query/list`: no auth required

### `message`
Inter-agent messaging.
- Actions: `send`, `get`, `mark_read`
- `send`: requires to_agent, content (`maxLength: 200`). Use `*` for broadcast.
- `get`: returns messages (unread_only defaults true)

### `plan`
Agent plans (what you're doing and why).
- Actions: `update`, `get`, `list`
- `update`: uses session identity + goal, current_task (`maxLength: 100` each)
- `get/list`: no auth required

### `status`
System overview: agents, locks, plans, recent messages. No auth required.

## Connection Lifecycle & Active Agents

There is **no subscribe tool**. Subscriptions are automatic — managed entirely by the server based on connection state.

### How it works

1. **First connection** — agent calls `register` with just `name` → server creates identity, returns key, marks agent **active**, opens [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) event stream. **The agent must store this key.**
2. **While connected** — server pushes all relevant events (lock changes, messages, plan updates, agent status changes) to the agent via [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) automatically
3. **Connection drops** (agent disconnects, crashes, network loss) → server immediately marks agent as **deactivated** in the DB and emits `agent_deactivated` to all remaining connections (agents + VSIX)
4. **Reconnect** — agent calls `register` with `key` only → server looks up the agent name from the key, marks agent **active** again, emits `agent_activated`. No new key is issued — the original key remains valid. Specifying `name` on reconnect is an error.

### Active agents in the DB

The `identity` table tracks connection state via an `active` column. The set of active agents **always matches** the set of agents with live [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) connections. This is the single source of truth — the VSIX reads it to show which agents are online.

### Events

All events are pushed automatically to every connected client (agents + VSIX):
- `agent_registered`, `agent_activated`, `agent_deactivated`
- `lock_acquired`, `lock_released`, `lock_renewed`
- `message_sent`
- `plan_updated`

### VSIX behavior

The VSIX connects to `/admin/events` ([HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http)) on startup and receives the same event stream. When an `agent_deactivated` event arrives, the VSIX immediately reflects this in the tree view (greyed out, offline indicator, etc.). No polling — the VSIX is purely reactive to push events.

---

## Session Identity

After calling `register`, the server stores the agent's name and key in per-connection session state. Subsequent tool calls (lock, message, plan) use the session identity automatically — agents don't pass `agent_name`/`agent_key` on every call.

---

## Admin REST Endpoints

Admin operations are exposed as REST endpoints on the server, **not** as MCP tools. Only the VSCode extension hits these. Agents cannot access them.

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Description |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| `/admin/delete-lock` | POST | `{ filePath }` | Force-delete a lock |
| `/admin/delete-agent` | POST | `{ agentName }` | Delete agent and all associated data |
| `/admin/reset-key` | POST | `{ agentName }` | Generate new key for agent |
| `/admin/send-message` | POST | `{ fromAgent, toAgent, content }` | Send message on behalf of agent (no auth) |
| `/admin/status` | GET | — | Full status (agents, locks, messages, plans) |
| `/admin/events` | GET ([HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http)) | — | [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) stream pushing all state changes to the VSIX in real-time |

## Package Structure

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `too_many_cooks_data/` | Data layer: DB ops, types, config, schema. Only used by the server. |
| `too_many_cooks/` | HTTP server. MCP endpoint for agents, admin REST endpoints for VSIX, event notifications. |
| `too_many_cooks_vscode_extension/` | VSCode extension. Talks to server via `/admin/*` REST endpoints. Receives all state changes via [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) push. Tree views for agents, locks, messages, plans. |

---

## Key Behaviors

1. **Session auth**: Register (name only) or reconnect (key only) per connection, session identity used for all subsequent calls
2. **Lock expiry**: Any agent can force_release expired locks
3. **Optimistic concurrency**: Version column on locks prevents races
4. **Retry policy**: 3 attempts, exponential backoff for transient SQLite errors
5. **Broadcast messages**: Use `*` as to_agent
6. **Real-time events**: Server pushes notifications to all connected agents and the VSIX via [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) — no polling
