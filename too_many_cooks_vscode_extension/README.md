# Too Many Cooks VSCode Extension

VSCode extension for visualizing multi-agent coordination. See [spec](../docs/spec.md).

Receives all state changes via [HTTP STREAMABLE TRANSPORT](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) push — no polling. Does **not** access the database directly. Provides tree views for agents, locks, messages, and plans. Admin operations (delete agent, delete lock, reset key, send message) available via command palette.
